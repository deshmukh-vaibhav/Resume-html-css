            <li id="title">Safe Yatra:</li><p>Safe Yatra, which addresses the problems of fatal road accidents, poor road health, and poor traffic management in India.The app, "Safe Yatra" aims to solve these issues by blocking distracting apps, regulating driving speeds, and providing route safety predictions. It includes features such as emergency ambulance services and specialized routes for women. The team plans to generate profits through government collaborations, location-based advertising, and premium subscriptions.</p>
            <li id="title">Density Based Smart traffic Control System:</li><p>The Density-Based Smart Traffic Control System uses real-time traffic data to adjust traffic light timing dynamically. The system is designed to reduce traffic congestion, improve flow, and minimize delays by prioritizing lanes with higher traffic volumes. It leverages ultrasonic sensors and RFID technology to monitor and process traffic density information. This system is adaptable, scalable, and aims to improve traffic management efficiency while reducing fuel consumption and driver frustration. Future developments include integrating AI and machine learning for enhanced real-time optimization.</p>
